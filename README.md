# Index Card Generator for AgileZen

A quick and - yes - dirty hook towards [AgileZen](http://www.agilezen.com) to extract stories from a specified project generating index cards with story contents.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository (i.e. `git clone ...`)
2. Configure config.js with project id and API-key
2. Run `npm install` in your favourite command line tool
3. Run `npm start` in the same favourite command line tool
4. Voil√°!

## Requirements

1. Node.js is mandatory for this to even work and you'll need to have an account at [AgileZen](http://www.agilezen.com).
2. You'll need to get an API key from AgileZen to be able to make requests to your projects.
3. You'll need a project id (int) wich you can retrieve from the URL of the project in AgileZen.

## Recognitions
